# Reactor-Temperature-Calculation

This Python program is useful to calculate the recator temerature for a given reaction.

This will take the following parameters and provide the temperature of the reactor:

 a)Type of Reaction
 
 b) Flow Rates
 
 c) Inlet Temperatures 
 
 d) Specific Heats of species 
 
 e) Heat Transfer Coefficients 
 
 f) Heat Transfer Area 
 
 g) Heat of formation
